# About Me

My name is Katherine York and I am working towards becoming a web developer. I previously worked in Transport Modelling & Analysis, where I gained some experience of coding using R and Python for analysing transport data, in particular geospatial data.

After a career break, during which time I did a campervan conversion, had a baby and went travelling, I have decided to pursue a career in web development.

In July and August 2023 I completed a FreeCodeCamp certification in Responsive Web Design using HTML and CSS. In August 2023 I started a course in Web Design & Development with the Coder's Guild.
